# INSTRUCTION SET

Cycles represent the "steps" in the micro-program counter. They start at 0 and can go up to 7, but most instructions only take 2 cycles.

Cycle 0 is exactly the same in every single instruction, since it only fetches the data from the ROM (MEM_RD) and latches it in the instruction register (nIR_LD) safely.

### $23 --> INC/DEC XY

Increments or Decrements the XY register pair. Bit 8 selects which instruction is made. 0 = INC, 1 = DEC. This instruction can be done because it doesn't need a source register, because now the accumulator is not the one performing arithmetic, meaning bits `[10:8]` are free to use. Since in this case, deciding between incrementing or decrementing is only a matter of changing the pin 5 (nU/D) of the 74191.
